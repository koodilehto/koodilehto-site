                    <p class="teaser">Remote monitoring and control station based on a single-board-computer, and embedded Linux.</p>
                    <p>Project Ahma was started in June 2010 at Ylitornio, Finland. This project by <a href="http://koodilehto.fi/projects/members#zouppen">Zouppen</a> illustrates our capabilities in remote monitoring systems and embedded Linux.</p>
                    <p>Since then we've used our expertise in other projects, <a href="http://www.elovalo.org">Elovalo</a> of which is the most important.</p>

                    <p class="teaser">UDP packet abstraction for multiple DMX controllers.</p>
                    <p>EffectServer is a good example our capabilities with DMX controllers. EffectServer makes it possible to control devices through web. The system has been used at a local demo party, <a href="http://www.instanssi.org">Instanssi</a> with great success. The system has made it possible for attendees to improve their demos and make the atmosphere even greater.</p>

                    <h3><a href="/projects/koodilehto">Koodilehto Site</a></h3>
                    <p>Building this site was quite a project of its own. Instead of building everything from scratch, we ended up using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>. In addition some custom technology, <a href="http://bebraw.github.com/caro.js/">this carousel</a> included, was developed.</p>
                    <p>It is an ongoing project and we work continuously to improve the site. It is a good example of our capabilities on web development and design. Besides doing sites we have expertise in technologies such as Django, Ruby on Rails and Node.js.</p>

                <div title="Elovalo">
                    <h3><a href="http://www.elovalo.org">Elovalo</a></h3>
                    <div class="right figure"><img alt="Elovalo led cube in development" src="/images/elovalo2.jpg" /></div>
                    <p class="teaser">Elovalo, a led cube and pedestal</p>
                    <p>Elovalo is a joint venture between <a href="http://www.hacklabjkl.org">Hacklab Jkl</a>, <a href="http://www.ihmemedia.fi">IhmeMedia</a> and Koodilehto. The cubes (3 pieces) resulting from the project have effective resolution of 512 voxels and are controllable using C code. Our graphics controller is based on AVR ATMega328 and is quite minimal yet effective.</p>
                    <p>The project is a good example of collaboration between local organizations. It showcases our expertise in embedded development and 3D graphics. One instance of this latter was <a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender3d</a> based simulator we implemented and then used to visualize our effects before actual hardware was ready.</p>
