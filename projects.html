            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <h3><a href="http://kryptoradio.koodilehto.fi/">Kryptoradio</a></h3>

            <p>Kryptoradio makes it possible to access the bitcoin network from anywhere, through DVB. It enables new ways to perform monetary transactions with minimal costs. Currently we are running trials on the technology at Finland.</p>

            <h3><a href="./ahma">Ahma</a></h3>

            <p>Remote monitoring and control station based on a single-board-computer, and embedded Linux.</p>

            <h3><a href="./koodilehto">Koodilehto Site</a></h3>

            <p>This site. It might look simple but it took a lot of effort to make it happen.</p>

            <h3><a href="./logo">Koodilehto Logo</a></h3>

            <p>Making of a logo. Where did the tree come from?</p>

            <h2>Personal Projects</h2>

            <h3>JavaScript</h3>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki">jswiki</a></h4>

            <p>jswiki is perhaps the most comprehensive JavaScript package index at the web. It's one of those projects that grew out of a need. There are a lot of packages out there but they're all scattered. This wiki brings some order to the chaos.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://bebraw.github.com/caro.js/">caro.js</a></h4>

            <p>There are a lot of carousel plugins out there. Nothing quite suit this site perfectly. As a result caro.js was born. It's relatively light, customizable and scalable. It fits the fluid layout of this site really nicely.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://bebraw.github.com/ellipsis.js/">ellipsis.js</a></h4>

            <p>This little plugin grew out of the GitHub commits widget visible at right. Sometimes the amount of commits per "push" could be quite big so it was quite messy visually. This plugin brought the situation under control.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://bebraw.github.com/yabox.js/">yabox.js</a></h4>

            <p>yabox is another one of those little plugins that grew out of this site. It has been kept as light as possible by design. There are some hooks that make it possible to extend it on demand.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/bebraw/more.js">more.js</a></h4>

            <p>more.js is a CSS preprocessor that grew out of a <a href="http://nixtu.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-to-write-css-preprocessor-using.html">blog post</a>. It's more of a proof of concept at the moment.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/bebraw/bunit.js">bunit.js</a></h4>

            <p>bunit.js makes it simple to write unit tests using JavaScript. It provides the basic structure for testing based on <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> and a simple, chaining assert. It is possible to use some other means of asserting as well.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/bebraw/colorjs">colorjs</a></h4>

            <p>colorjs provides a simple chaining API for dealing various color related operations (conversions and such).</p>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/bebraw/qdemo">qdemo</a></h4>

            <p>qdemo makes it easy to write interactive demo pages for jQuery plugins.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>

            <h4><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/speccer/">Speccer</a></h4>

            <p>Speccer is one of those projects that makes unit testing a tiny bit easier. It provides minimal syntax and lets the programmer focus on the essential.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyqa/">pyqa</a></h4>

            <p>pyqa makes it a lot easier to write those scripts that ask a bunch of things and then uses that information somehow.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc/">pypandoc</a></h4>

            <p>pypandoc wraps <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>, a universal document converter and makes it easy to use via Python.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://packages.python.org/iterplus/">iterplus</a></h4>

            <p>iterplus provides a set of functions that complement Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html">itertools</a>.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/bebraw/Placidity">Placidity</a></h4>

            <p>Placidity is an interactive interpreter that grew out of a series of blogposts. It sits on top of terminal and provides some additional functionality (variables and such).</p>

            <h3>PHP</h3>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/bebraw/tinytest">TinyTest</a></h4>

            <p>TinyTest provides light syntax for writing PHP unit tests.</p>
